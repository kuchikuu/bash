# bash
My scripts written in bash

https://github.com/kuchikuu/bash/blob/master/start-lite.sh - So I compiled "lite" text editor, and it looked neat at first, but when I tried to make it a global command, I failed miserably. No idea what to do, I made my own bash script that starts the program, and corrects the "project directory" path to the one I'm currently in.
